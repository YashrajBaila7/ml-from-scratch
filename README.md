# ml-from-scratch
Implementing Machine Learning algorithms from scratch using NumPy and pandas.
Inspired by Stanford's CS229 (Autumn 2018), this repository is a hands-on journey into the mathematical, statistical, and programmatic foundations of modern machine learning.
## Project Goals
. Reinforce understanding of core ML algorithms by building them step-by-step

. Avoid high-level libraries like Scikit-learn to focus on the actual mechanics

. Reproduce and extend concepts from Stanford CS229 Lectures with visualizations

. Provide clean, modular, and well-documented notebooks for each algorithm
